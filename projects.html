            <p>in this project, i built a churn prediction model to identify customers likely to leave. i cleaned and prepared the data, removed weak features, and trained several models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, SVM, and XGBoost. after tuning and comparing their performance using accuracy and ROC-AUC scores, XGBoost gave the best results. i also used feature importance and SHAP values to interpret the key factors influencing churn.</p>

            <p>in this project, i loaded the dataset, analyzed feature importance, and removed less useful ones. i encoded categorical data, handled missing values, and balanced the dataset using SMOTE. after splitting the data into training and testing parts, i trained four models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting—and evaluated their performance. finally, i compared the models using accuracy, classification reports, ROC curves, and AUC scores, where all models achieved over 85% accuracy with the highest recall of 0.75.</p>

            <p>in this project, i analyzed a dataset to predict customer happiness. i checked the data, removed unnecessary columns, trained multiple models, and evaluated their performance. after testing, i found that the dataset didn’t have useful patterns to make accurate predictions. finally, i visualized the results and concluded that the data itself limited the model’s performance.</p>
